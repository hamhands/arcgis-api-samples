# ArcGIS API Samples

This is a place to store notebooks I make using the [ArcGIS API for Python](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/). Used primarily to support workshops and webinars.

To make use of anything you find in here, be sure to check out the [getting started](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/install-and-set-up/) section of the api docs for full install instructions.
